# tchibo_puzzle
The game is based on a physical one bought in Tchibo store. The original one is a wooden board with a set of colorful marble balls.

## Rules
The pieces move like in Checkers, so you can jump over another piece only if the field behind is free to take.
The overall goal is to end with a single ball on the center.

## Modes
* Basic ðŸ”„ - you start with 32 balls and solve it such that you end with only a one piece 
* Rush Mode ðŸ”¥- here you start on level 2 (2 balls) and you go to the next level when you end with one ball, if you fail you have to manually reset the game
* Puzzle Mode ðŸ§© - in this mode you can specifie the number of balls you start with and play just like in normal mode

In both rush and puzzle mode you are guarantied that the board is solvable due to the algorithim which sets the balls.
The algorithim starts with a single ball in the center and makes reverse moves such that it moves a piece 2 fields away and adds a ball between fields. 
Here is example with moving ball 2 units to the right 'O _ _' --> '_ O O'
